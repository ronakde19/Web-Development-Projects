    <h2>My First Blog</h2>
    <p>This is my First Blog, I am very excited today while walking towards the park. I met little cute puppies. Yet, they were so small and have tiny eyes and the tails were swinging around 1200 RPM Speed. It was really fun to watch them. While I was passing by I stopped there for a bit and forwarded my arm to them.</p>
    <p>While I was showing them my arm both the puppies looked at my arm then my face and again towards my arm and I looked at their innocent cute faces, they were like happy, confused and mostly don't know how to react. When I touched them, they moved little back and got little scared. Yet My mood was so good I made some cute new paw friends.</p>
